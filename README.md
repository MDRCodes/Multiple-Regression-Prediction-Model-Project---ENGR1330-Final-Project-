The power output multiple regression prediction model takes the four parameters in the csv file and plots the user inputted inputs, for each parameter, against the real plotted data to give context to power output results. It utilizes simple data science techniques from python packages such as pandas for data science functions.

Overall, an extremely valuable application of data science for me, to go from uncleaned data to descriptive predictions that can be analyzed for trends and future applications. I have learned the whole process and have a good feel on each role and their purpose.
